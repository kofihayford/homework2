2nd Homework Submission

This homework was more challenging than the first. 
I utilized Bootstrap primarily to get the overall form but then employed a local CSS file to add further modifications to get the site as close to what I saw in the document as possible.

Navbar
It mimics what the homework described quite well except in one factor: The sandwich that appears as the page shrinks horizonally no longer worked after I had made a lot of changes at once without checking the broader implications of those changes on other functionality. I tried removing code I had added but grew concerned about my inability to roll those changes back so I left the flaw in there. 

Index 
The one major challenge I had here was trying to get the text to wrap around below the picture. 
I was never able to get that to work properly. 
Everything else seems to work fine though. 

Portfolio 
Getting the pictures to align and behave properly was resolved by using sections, containers, rows, and columns. 
It was relatively easy to complete. 

Contact 
This was by far the easiest portion of the homework. 
The bootstrap elements worked quite well. 
I had to borrow parts from other bootstrap elements to create the right layout.
