        <div class="col"> <p> <strong> Kofi Hayford</strong>, Ghanaian-American bass, described as possessing an “impressive” (Brooklyn Discovery) “sonorous,” (Meet Me at the Opera) and “stentorian bass voice” (National Herald) also produces a distinct sound - easily identified for its unique timbre. With over 30 different operatic roles under his belt, he is swiftly building his reputation as an accomplished young bass by bringing an ‘exciting’ and ‘stunning’ sound to the stage. Kofi’s talents have taken him as far as the Artic Circle - performing a series of concerts in the Northwest Territories in Canada. Mr. Hayford has sung with many opera companies, orchestras and prestigious organizations across North America including: the Metropolitan Opera Guild, United Nations Symphony Orchestra, Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, NJ Verismo Opera, Gateway Classical Music Society, Connecticut Lyric Opera, and many others. He continues to expand his careers singing internationally.
